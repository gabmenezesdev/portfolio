            Currently, I'm honing my skills as a senior developer at Medisigh, where I focus on enhancing user experience and optimizing performance using techniques like lazy loading, caching, and pagination. I enjoy collaborating with small, nimble teams and am always looking to improve through teamwork and constant learning.
